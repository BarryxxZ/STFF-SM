# STFF-SM: Steganalysis Model Based on Spatial and Temporal Feature Fusion for Speech Streams
To promote the development of speech steganalysis, we release the code for our previous TASLP 2022 paper:

## üèÅ Quick Start

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Dependencies:

1. Installing anaconda and python (our version == 3.8.10).

2. Creating the new environment and install the requirements.

   ```
   conda create -n STFF_SM python=3.8
   
   conda activate STFF_SM
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

------

### üì© Prepare Dataset:

Due to the limited space of the cloud storage, we give up uploading our own datasets here. To train the model, you should extract integer and fractional pitch delays of your own speech samples to .txt files. Each row of .txt flies should consist of integer and fractional pitch delays of each frame of the speech sample.

Preparing them and place them into `dataset/`.

```
${SepSteNetwithDPES}
|-- dataset              <-- the prepared dataset

	|-- Yan
	|-- Liu
|-- model_weights
|-- model.py
|-- train.py
|-- module.py
|-- other python codes, LICENSE, and README files
```

### üì• Save Model Weights:

Saving the weights of trained models and place them into `model_weights/`.

```
${STFF_SM}
|-- dataset
|-- model_weights        <-- the downloaded weights of trained models
|-- model.py
|-- train.py
|-- module.py
|-- other python codes, LICENSE, and README files
```

------

### üíª Starting train or inference

For example, if you want to inference on samples of 1.0s embedded by Huang‚Äôs method at the 10% embedding rate:

```
python ./train.py --length 1.0 --em_rate 10 --method Huang --train Flase -- test True
```

Or if you want to train the model, please set `‚Äìtrain` to `True`.
